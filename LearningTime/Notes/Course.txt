You are my personal Angular 20 mentor.  
Teach me Angular 20 step-by-step from the very beginning to advanced topics — in a very simple and beginner-friendly way.

Assume I only know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and some MERN basics).  
Explain everything clearly with setup instructions, concepts, and small examples.

Please cover the following topics in order:

### 📍 PHASE 1: Getting Started
- What Angular is and how it works (difference from React)
- Installing Node.js and Angular CLI
- Creating the first Angular 20 app (step-by-step terminal commands)
- Understanding project structure and files (src, main.ts, app.module.ts, etc.)
- How Angular compiles and runs
- How to run the development server and view changes

### 📍 PHASE 2: Core Building Blocks
- What is a Component (with simple example)
- How to create and use multiple components
- Component decorator and metadata
- Templates, Styles, and Selectors
- Data Binding (Interpolation, Property Binding, Event Binding)
- Two-Way Binding with ngModel

### 📍 PHASE 3: Directives and Pipes
- What are Directives (Structural vs Attribute)
- Using *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch
- Built-in Pipes (date, uppercase, currency)
- Creating custom Pipes

### 📍 PHASE 4: Modules and Routing
- Understanding Angular Modules (NgModule)
- Creating feature modules
- Setting up routing and navigation
- RouterLink, RouterOutlet, and route parameters
- Lazy loading routes

### 📍 PHASE 5: Services and Dependency Injection
- What services are and why we use them
- How to create and inject a service
- Sharing data between components using a service

### 📍 PHASE 6: Forms and Validation
- Template-driven forms (with ngModel)
- Reactive forms (FormBuilder, FormGroup, FormControl)
- Built-in validators and custom validation
- Showing validation messages

### 📍 PHASE 7: HTTP and APIs
- Using HttpClientModule
- Making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
- Handling responses and errors
- Displaying data from an API in a component

### 📍 PHASE 8: Observables and RxJS
- What Observables are
- How to subscribe and unsubscribe
- Using async pipe
- Common RxJS operators (map, filter, tap)

### 📍 PHASE 9: Authentication & Guards
- Adding JWT-based login and signup
- Using route guards (AuthGuard)
- Storing tokens securely (localStorage)
- Redirecting users after login/logout

### 📍 PHASE 10: Angular CLI & Optimization
- Common CLI commands
- Building the project for production
- Performance tips (ChangeDetectionStrategy, OnPush, trackBy)
- Lazy loading optimization

### 📍 PHASE 11: Deployment
- How to build a production bundle
- Deploy Angular app on:
  - Firebase Hosting
  - GitHub Pages
  - Vercel or Netlify

### 📍 PHASE 12: Real-World Project
Give me a small full-stack project idea (like a “Task Manager” or “SolarHub Dashboard”) using Angular 20 + Node.js backend.  
Include:
- Frontend structure (components, modules, routes)
- Backend API endpoints
- Example of connecting Angular frontend to Node backend via HTTP

For every topic:
✅ Explain in plain English  
✅ Include small code examples  
✅ Show terminal commands if needed  
✅ Suggest one mini project for practice  
✅ Provide free resource links (YouTube, Docs, Tutorials)

Keep explanations simple and clear for self-learning.
